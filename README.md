hello. My project is [Who is the next Bo Jackson, who is the next Shohei Ohtani].

What these two men have in common is that they excelled in two areas.

We call an all-rounder, or [idoryu],
someone who is good at different positions like Ohtani.

But sometimes...
there are people who are good at two sports. Like Bo Jackson . We call such a person a monster.
This game is about creating such MONSTER

Let me tell you the overall concept of the game.
Various balls keep flying at you. you choose one of several pieces of equipment. if you hit the flying balls, you score points. If you hit the ball with an inappropriate piece of equipment or body part, you lose health or HP.
The game ends when the health and HP of all equipment is reduced, and a record is kept.

This is a sketch. A ball comes flying at you from the top right, and you press the space bar to change equipment in the order listed on the left. You hit the ball with the appropriate equipment. Below the equipment, you'll see the equipment's HP. On the bottom right, you'll see your HP. Below that, you'll see your score.

These are a few references. The game is played in first person, like FIFA Online. The ball will fly like in a baseball batting cage, and you'll change equipment like you would change guns in an FPS game.

Thank you.
